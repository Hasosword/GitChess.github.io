# GitChess.github.io
Chess on Github
Just go to the website (GitChess.github.io) 

in order to fork make sure you make the title    "example.github.io"  YOU NEED THE GITHUB.IO 

after the code is propeerly forked then you go to settings in the tab with code and issues and stuff (to the far right of the tabs) 
in settings go to the pages section and select the dropdown deploy from branch
then select main in the next drop down

after forking check the site periodicly and if it doesnt work within 13 minutes then something is wrong.
